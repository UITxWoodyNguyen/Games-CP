                              ABOUT THE GAME
================================================================================

Hanoi Tower is a classic mathematical puzzle game now brought to life with a 
modern, interactive web interface. Your goal is to move all discs from one 
tower to another while following strict rules.

This game features:
  • Classic puzzle gameplay with 3-8 disc options
  • Smooth drag-and-drop or click-to-move controls
  • Online leaderboard with real-time rankings
  • Auto Solve feature for hints (5 moves max)
  • Dark/White mode toggle
  • Mobile-friendly responsive design
  • Local storage for game state persistence

================================================================================
                            HOW TO PLAY
================================================================================

MAIN GOAL:
  Move all discs from one tower to another tower (usually from left to right).

BASIC RULES:
  1. Only ONE disc can be moved at a time
  2. You can only move the TOP disc from a tower
  3. A LARGER disc can NEVER be placed on top of a SMALLER disc
  4. You have 5 minutes per game
  5. Limited moves based on disc count

GAME MODES:
  
  Manual Selection:
    - Choose the number of discs (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8)
    - Start the game directly
  
  Spin Mode:
    - Enter your name first
    - Click the spinning wheel button
    - Spin to randomly select disc count (1 spin allowed)
    - Go directly to game after spinning

HOW TO MOVE DISCS:
  
  Method 1 - Drag & Drop:
    1. Click and hold a disc
    2. Drag it to target tower
    3. Release to drop
  
  Method 2 - Click Selection:
    1. Click a disc to select it (border appears)
    2. Click the target tower to place it
    3. If move is invalid, disc stays selected

WINNING:
  - Move all discs to tower 2 (rightmost) in correct order
  - You'll see success message and leaderboard ranking

================================================================================

MOVE LIMIT:
  Maximum moves = 2^n + 5 (where n = disc count)
  Example: 5 discs = 2^5 + 5 = 37 moves max

TIMER:
  • 5 minutes (300 seconds) per game
  • Time is tracked for leaderboard ranking
  • Lose if time runs out

RESTART:
  • Can restart once per game
  • Resets moves, timer, and discs
  • Useful if you make mistakes

STATE PERSISTENCE:
  • Game progress saved locally in browser
  • Theme preference remembered
  • Player name cached for convenience

                          ALGORITHM INFO
================================================================================

HANOI TOWER MATHEMATICS:

Classic Problem:
  - 3 pegs/towers
  - N discs of different sizes
  - Goal: Move all discs to destination peg

Minimum Moves Formula:
  Moves = 2^n - 1  (where n = number of discs)
  
  Examples:
    3 discs  = 2^3 - 1 = 7 moves minimum
    5 discs  = 2^5 - 1 = 31 moves minimum
    8 discs  = 2^8 - 1 = 255 moves minimum

RECURSIVE ALGORITHM (used in Auto Solve):
  1. Move (n-1) discs from Source to Auxiliary peg
  2. Move largest disc from Source to Destination peg
  3. Move (n-1) discs from Auxiliary to Destination peg

Time Complexity: O(2^n)
Space Complexity: O(n) - recursive call stack

AUTO SOLVE ENHANCEMENT:
  This game's auto solve can work from ANY disc configuration, not just 
  the starting state. It analyzes the current position and generates the 
  correct sequence to reach the solved state.

================================================================================
                         TIPS & STRATEGIES
================================================================================

FOR BEGINNERS:

1. Start with 3 discs to learn the pattern
2. Remember: smaller discs must always be on top
3. Plan your moves - don't rush
4. Use the 5-minute timer wisely
5. If stuck, use Auto Solve for guidance (but it counts toward your hint!)

FOR ADVANCED PLAYERS:

1. Aim for minimum moves (2^n - 1)
2. Optimize time - speed matters for leaderboard
3. Try 7-8 discs for maximum challenge
4. Compete on specific disc counts (filter by count)
5. Study the pattern to anticipate sequences

GENERAL STRATEGY:

• Focus on moving the largest disc early
• Keep smaller discs organized as temporary stacks
• Don't block yourself - plan 2-3 moves ahead
• Use the Auxiliary tower (middle) strategically
• Practice - patterns repeat across disc counts

================================================================================
                            TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Discs won't move
SOLUTION: 
  - Check if game is over (time/moves limit reached)
  - Click "Restart" to reset the game
  - Refresh page if UI is frozen

PROBLEM: Leaderboard not updating
SOLUTION:
  - Check internet connection
  - Leaderboard auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
  - Manual refresh may be needed on older browsers

PROBLEM: Dark mode not saving
SOLUTION:
  - Ensure localStorage is enabled in browser settings
  - Clear browser cache if theme doesn't persist
  - Toggle dark/white mode again

PROBLEM: Game too easy/hard
SOLUTION:
  - Decrease disc count if too hard
  - Increase disc count if too easy
  - Use "Spin" mode for random difficulty

PROBLEM: Timer running out
SOLUTION:
  - Plan moves more efficiently
  - Practice with fewer discs first
  - Aim for minimum move count (2^n - 1)

================================================================================
                         KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

================================================================================
                            ABOUT THE PUZZLE
================================================================================

HISTORY:
  Invented by French mathematician Édouard Lucas in 1883
  Also known as "Tower of Brahma" or "End of the World Puzzle"

THE LEGEND:
  In a temple, monks move 64 golden discs on diamond pegs
  Following the rules of the puzzle
  When they finish, the world will end (according to legend)
  
  At 1 move per second:
  64 discs would take 2^64 - 1 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 seconds
  That's about 585 BILLION years!

MATHEMATICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
  • Classic example of recursive problem-solving
  • Demonstrates exponential growth
  • Used in computer science education
  • Connected to binary numbers
  • Application in algorithm design
